# Block Debug

This plugin adds a panel to the WordPress block editor that allows you to inspect and modify the selected block. You can:

- Copy the block name
- Copy the block client ID
- View the block object (from `select('core/block-editor').getBlock()`)
- View the block type object
- View the output of `useBlockProps()`
- View and copy the serialized block HTML
- View and edit most block attributes (see the "Editing Attributes" section below)

## Installation

You can install the plugin via Composer:

```bash
composer require alleyinteractive/wp-block-debug
```

## Editing Attributes

The interface for editing block attributes is generated by passing the block type's `attributes` schema to [`react-jsonschema-form`](https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form). Some attributes might be easier to edit than others, and some attributes might not be editable at all, depending on how well-defined the attributes are in the schema (you can use the "Dump block type" feature in the debug panel to see it).

Only attributes with a type of `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, or `null` are supported; items of type `array` must also define an `items` schema.
